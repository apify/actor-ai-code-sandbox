# Apify AI Code Sandbox

Secure, isolated container for executing arbitrary code — built for AI coding agents and untrusted code. Connect over **MCP**, a **REST API**, or an **interactive browser shell**. Ships with **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode** pre-configured and ready to launch. 🚀

> 💡 Open the Actor's **landing page** (the container URL, shown in the run log and Actor output) for live connection details, one-click shell/agent launches, a health badge, and the idle-shutdown countdown. The same docs are served as machine-readable Markdown at `/llms.txt`.

## Use cases

- **Run untrusted or AI-generated code safely** in an isolated container with controlled resources.
- **Give AI agents a managed workspace** to write, run, and test code — with state that survives container migrations.
- **Drop in over MCP** so any MCP client gains code-execution and filesystem tools, no glue code.
- **Pair with coding agents** (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode) right in the browser shell.
- **Expose internal services** (dev servers, dashboards, TUIs) at a public URL with bridges.
- **Orchestrate Apify Actors** using the limited-permission `APIFY_TOKEN` available inside the sandbox to run other [limited-permission Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/permissions) and build data pipelines.

## Quickstart

1. Run the Actor on the [Apify platform](https://console.apify.com/) (Console or API).
2. Open the **landing page** — the container URL from the run log / Actor output — for live links and connection details.
3. Connect with an MCP client, call the REST API, or open the shell.

Examples below use `https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net` as the container URL — replace it with your run's URL.

## 🖥️ Interactive shell — `/shell`

Browser terminal (powered by ttyd) for hands-on work inside the sandbox.

- `…/shell` — plain Bash shell.
- `…/shell?launch=claude` — launch **Claude Code**.
- `…/shell?launch=codex` — launch **Codex CLI**.
- `…/shell?launch=opencode` — launch **OpenCode**.
- `…/shell?launch=<command>` — run any command, then drop into a shell.

The coding agents are installed on first use and start pre-configured against the Apify OpenRouter proxy (billed as OpenRouter API usage).

## 📡 Connect with MCP — `/mcp`

Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint, no authentication required:

```
https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/mcp
```

Add it to a client:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sandbox https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/mcp
codex mcp add sandbox --url https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/mcp
mcpc connect https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/mcp @sandbox
```

Tools exposed: `execute` (shell / JS / TS / Python), `read-file`, `write-file`, `list-files`.

## ⚡ Code execution API — `/exec`

`POST /exec` runs a shell command or a code snippet.

- Body: `{ command: string; language?: string; cwd?: string; timeoutSecs?: number }`
- `language`: `bash`/`sh` (or omit) for shell; `js`/`javascript`, `ts`/`typescript`, `py`/`python` for code.
- Returns `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode, language }` — `200` on success, `500` on a non-zero exit or error.

```bash
curl -X POST https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/exec \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "print(\"hi\")", "language": "py", "timeoutSecs": 10}'
```

Default working directories: shell → `/sandbox`, JS/TS → `/sandbox/js-ts`, Python → `/sandbox/py`. Override with `cwd` (must stay within `/sandbox`).

## 📁 Filesystem API — `/fs`

Direct file operations over HTTP. All paths are relative to `/sandbox` and validated to stay inside it.

- `GET /fs/{path}` — read a file (raw bytes) or list a directory (JSON `{ path, entries }`). Add `?download=1` to get a file as an attachment or a directory as a ZIP.
- `PUT /fs/{path}` — write/replace a file (creates parent dirs; up to 500 MB).
- `POST /fs/{path}?mkdir=1` — create a directory; `?append=1` — append to a file.
- `DELETE /fs/{path}` — delete; add `?recursive=1` for non-empty directories.
- `HEAD /fs/{path}` — return metadata in the response headers.

```bash
curl https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/fs/app/log.txt                            # read
curl -X PUT https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/fs/config.json -d '{"key":"value"}' # write
curl -X POST "https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/fs/project/src?mkdir=1"           # mkdir
curl -X DELETE "https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/fs/temp?recursive=1"            # delete
```

Prefer a UI? Browse the filesystem at `/browse`.

## 🔀 Bridges — `/bridges`

Expose a web server you start **inside** the sandbox at a public URL path on the container, reachable over HTTP and WebSocket. Each bridge forwards `…/{path}` → `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/…`.

- `GET /bridges` — list current bridges.
- `POST /bridges` — add one: `{ "path": "/myapp", "target": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/myapp" }`.
- `PUT /bridges` — replace all: `{ "bridges": [ … ] }`.
- `DELETE /bridges/{path}` — remove one.

```bash
# Start a server inside the sandbox, then expose it:
curl -X POST https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/bridges \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/myapp", "target": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"}'
# Now reachable at https://UNIQUE-ID.runs.apify.net/myapp/
```

Bridges can also be set via the `bridges` input or by writing `/sandbox/.bridges.json` (changes are picked up live). Longest-path matching and `Location`-header rewriting are automatic, and bridges persist across restarts.

## Health & status — `/health`

`GET /health` reports the service state:

- `200 { status: "healthy", idleTimeoutSecs, remainingSecs? }`
- `503 { status: "initializing" }` — dependencies / setup script still running.
- `503 { status: "unhealthy", message }` — setup failed; check the run log.

`remainingSecs` counts down to idle shutdown and is present only while an idle timeout is active.

## Configuration

All inputs are optional. Set them in the Actor input form or via the API.

| Input                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent skills** (`agentSkills`)               | SKILLS.md packages for the coding agents — `owner/repo` or a repo URL per line, or a JSON array. Defaults to `apify/agent-skills`. See [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/). |
| **Node.js dependencies** (`nodeDependencies`)  | npm packages for JS/TS execution. One `package@version` per line (npm-style), or a `package.json`-style JSON object.                                                    |
| **Python requirements** (`pythonRequirements`) | pip packages for Python execution, in `requirements.txt` format.                                                                                                        |
| **MCP connectors** (`mcpConnectors`)           | MCP connectors to pre-load into Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode, and write to `/sandbox/mcp.json` for `mcpc`.                                                          |
| **Setup script** (`initBashScript`)            | Bash script run on startup after dependencies install. Output streams to the log (tagged `[init]`) with a progress heartbeat; 5-minute timeout.                         |
| **Environment variables** (`envVars`)          | Secret variables exposed **only to the setup script**, then removed before the shell, MCP server, and code execution start. dotenv or JSON; encrypted at rest.          |
| **Idle timeout** (`idleTimeoutSecs`)           | Seconds of inactivity before automatic shutdown (default `900`; `0` disables). Activity includes HTTP requests and shell interaction.                                   |
| **Bridges** (`bridges`)                        | Bridges to create at startup (see above).                                                                                                                               |

Dependencies install at startup before any code runs. For cost efficiency, set the Actor's **Execution Timeout to 0 (infinite)** and let the idle timeout manage the lifecycle. Note that every request to the Actor has a 5-minute ceiling, so each operation must finish within that window.

## Sandbox environment

- **Base image:** Debian Trixie with **Node.js 24** and **Python 3** (`venv` at `/sandbox/py/venv`).
- **Pre-installed tools:** git, openssh-client, curl, wget, jq, build-essential, `tsx`, `apify-cli`, `mcpc`, and `ttyd`; `apify-client` is ready in both the Node and Python environments.
- **Coding agents:** Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode — installed on first launch and wired to the Apify OpenRouter proxy (authenticated with `APIFY_TOKEN`).
- **Working directories:** `/sandbox` (shell), `/sandbox/js-ts` (npm packages in `node_modules`), `/sandbox/py` (Python venv).
- **Persistence:** filesystem changes are backed up to the Actor's key-value store and restored after a container migration, so work survives restarts (dependency directories are excluded and reinstalled).
- **Agent context:** `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are placed in `/sandbox` to guide the coding agents.
